# Aerial_Object_Classification_And_Detection
This project aims to develop a computer vision based solution that can classify aerial images into two categories — Bird or Drone. It will perform object detection and classification to locate and label these objects in real-world scenes.

The solution will help in security surveillance, wildlife protection, and airspace safety where accurate identification between drones and birds is critical. The project involves building a Custom CNN classification model, leveraging transfer learning, and implementing YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The final solution will be deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.

#Project Structure:
1. Data Collection: Daa can be collected in 3 ways
    - Collect the ready made data available in the internet - (In this project we have already collected data which is annotated as well)
    - Have a team of data annotators and send them to the field collect and annotate data
    - Web Scraping script to collect necessary images and annotate the images
2.
