# Aerial_Object_Classification_And_Detection
This project aims to develop a computer vision based solution that can classify aerial images into two categories — Bird or Drone. It will perform object detection and classification to locate and label these objects in real-world scenes.

The solution will help in security surveillance, wildlife protection, and airspace safety where accurate identification between drones and birds is critical. The project involves building a Custom CNN classification model, leveraging transfer learning, and implementing YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The final solution will be deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.
